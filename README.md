It's coming in the next days.

HotelRec, a very large-scale hotel recommendation dataset, based on TripAdvisor, containing 50 million reviews.

   "text":"Great customer service and good restaurant service is what made this experience so wonderful for my family. Giulianuova is a pretty simple , not so \"wow\" town, with not very clean beaches as I was expecting when booking my reservation. What saved my vacation was staying at Baltic. Baltic is a very simple but functional hotel, but what makes it so special are the people that work there. It seems that as a part of their job training they had take some kind of class on humanity and spirituality, because the way they treat every single person with respect and smile is just amazing. Good job to the manager Massimo (who knows how to hire great people)!",
